```{R}
# This R environment comes with many helpful analytics packages installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/rstats Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats
# For example, here's a helpful package to load

library(tidyverse) # metapackage of all tidyverse packages
library(tidymodels) # metapackage of tidy modeling

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list
all files under the input directory

list.files(path = "../input")

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that
gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved
outside of the current session
